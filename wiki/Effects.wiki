*Usage*

Effects are timed 'effects' on an Entity (most likely just the player). They have a start time and an end time, an attribute that they're attached to such as strength, and a value (positive or negative) that they add/subtract from that attribute.

*Duplicating Effects on an Entity:* If an Effect is added twice, the length of the second divided by 2 is added to the length of the first.

_Example:_ Drunk, start=500, end=1500, attribute="Dodge", value=-5

*List*

_Drunk:_ Negatively affects movement, perception, attacking ability, generally for an hour or so. Raises strength.

_Tired:_ Negatively affects a wide variety of attributes such as strength, endurance, defensive abilities, and attacking abilities. Is indefinite until rest or caffeine is ingested.
